### Day 3: Jan 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: kind of implemented multiple shots!

### Day 4: Jan 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: did some pair programming

### Day 5: Jan 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: one shot added to the array per press

**Thoughts:** still stamming unlimited shots, but now only ONE shot is pushed onto the array per space bar press, so that's something.

### Day 6: Jan 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: multi shot now active, colisions repairs, code cleaned up a bit.

**Thoughts:** on a tangential note, I find myself having a 2nd wind from 9pm to 11pm - more able to work after work than before.

### Day 9: Jan 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  created an instance of an asteroid

**Thoughts:** rn it speeds up infinitely, need to apply the same friction that the ship uses.

### Day 14: Jan 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  steps towards splitting the asteroids apart when destroyed

**Thoughts:** I can delete the collider from the collider array, but the asteroids are still being drawn, and animated. Need to act on their objects in main.js I think.

### Day 16: Jan 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Solved the shot speed problem, but now my spawning seems to be off.
