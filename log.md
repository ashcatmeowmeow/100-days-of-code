**Today's Progress**: Tried to implement multiple shots

### Day 3: Jan 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: kind of implemented multiple shots!

**Thoughts:** I can fire more than one shot at a time, but can't...stop firing shots.

### Day 4: Jan 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: did some pair programming

### Day 5: Jan 11, 2016

**Today's Progress**: one shot added to the array per press

**Thoughts:** still stamming unlimited shots, but now only ONE shot is pushed onto the array per space bar press, so that's something.

### Day 6: Jan 12, 2016

**Today's Progress**: multi shot now active, colisions repairs, code cleaned up a bit.

**Thoughts:** on a tangential note, I find myself having a 2nd wind from 9pm to 11pm - more able to work after work than before.
